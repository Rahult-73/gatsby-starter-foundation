I have read he book **rich dad poor dad** for days ago it has really changed y life very much which i have never experienced before that i'm now feeling very more intelligent then before and more confident in making the money.

This books shows us how the education system in our country is teach us about the finance that we work , save and buy an house or car.

Have a decent job don't take any risk.

Take loans to reduce tax.

Work hard to earn more.

These all are the sentences we hear more often in our daily life.

But this book will show u the other dimension of the world the world which filled with intelligent peoples motivated peoples and billionares and enterpreners who think work hard to earn more is an bullshit.
